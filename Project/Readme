Run on PACE ICE (linux): use make file and run make.
Run on Mac OS: use make file and add -lGEW in the first line. Also in all files that I used: #include <GL/glut.h> // on linux , you need to comment this line and uncomment the: //#include <GLUT/glut.h> //on MAC

Important notes:
1- I uploaded couple of videos that shows different stages of the game are working properly.
2- There are couple of scenarios for various stages of the game not mentioned in the questions. After talking with TA, I come up with reasonable scenarios:
A-If a ghost is in the home location and pacman easts power up, the white ghost can stay there since this is the safest location it can go. The whole point of the going the furthest point! After time limitation of being white is ended, if the time of being released is also ended, the ghost(s) in home location go(es) out of the home location. 
B-When the ghosts are adjacent to each other since they have volume and are 3D, you might see some overlapping especially when they are passing the same path.
C- I used functions to show Lives and Scores. Due to unavailability of GLEW library and also using "glWindowPos2i(100, 450)" function I was not able to compile and show it on the PACE ICE (linux). I asked professor to asked admin to install library but eventually it didn't happen. So, I am not able to show it when running on PACE ICE (linux). I was able to run it on Mac though. Please look at the Lives-Scores.png that is for the time I run on Mac. You may see it at the beginning when you run on PACE ICE (linux). It will not stay there permanently due to library problems of server. However, eventually it is an optional item. I did it for more points if you can do it.
D-When the ghosts become white and go far away if they reach to a wall and this is the furthest point to the Pacman they stay there until the Pacman location is updated and the furthest point is changed. 
F-The speed of the ghost and packman are attribute of the class so you can change it easily to make the game easier or more difficult. 
G-When I run it on Mac or PACE-ICE the speed and perhaps time elapsing units are different. So, you may face the fact that it may take longer time for ghosts to being released if you run it on the PACE-ICE but this works properly when I run on MAC. This might be due to different issues like time dedicate to me or the server being busy or free or other issues.
